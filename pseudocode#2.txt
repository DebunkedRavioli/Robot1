// --- Initialization ---
Initialize EV3 sensors (color sensor, ultrasonic sensor, motor ports)
Define target color RED
Define target color YELLOW
Define red_dropoff_position
Define yellow_dropoff_position
Define search_speed
Define transport_speed
Define obstacle_avoidance_distance
Define search_pattern  // e.g., spiral, back and forth

// --- Main Program ---

// --- Search and Collect ---
Function search_and_collect():
  While red_block_collected is FALSE or yellow_block_collected is FALSE:
    Follow the defined search_pattern at search_speed
    If ultrasonic sensor detects obstacle within obstacle_avoidance_distance:
      Perform obstacle_avoidance()
    If color sensor detects target color RED and red_block_collected is FALSE:
      Stop moving
      Grab the red block
      red_block_collected = TRUE
      Navigate to red_dropoff_position at transport_speed
      Release the red block
      // Optionally, return to the search area
    Else If color sensor detects target color YELLOW and yellow_block_collected is FALSE:
      Stop moving
      Grab the yellow block
      yellow_block_collected = TRUE
      Navigate to yellow_dropoff_position at transport_speed
      Release the yellow block
      // Optionally, return to the search area

// --- Obstacle Avoidance ---
Function perform_obstacle_avoidance():
  Stop moving
  Move backward slightly
  Turn left or right randomly (small angle)
  Move forward briefly

// --- Navigation (Simplified) ---
Function navigate_to_position(target_position, speed):
 Display message "Moving towards target position..."
    // Example using time-based movement (adjust durations based on testing):
    If target_position is equal to red_dropoff_position:
        // Logic to move to red drop-off (e.g., move forward for a specific time, turn, etc.)
        Move forward at speed for 5 seconds (motors A and D forward) // Placeholder duration
    Else if target_position is equal to yellow_dropoff_position:
        // Logic to move to yellow drop-off
        Move forward at speed for 8 seconds (motors A and D forward) // Placeholder duration
    End If
    Wait for 1 second
    Display message "Reached target position (approximate)."
