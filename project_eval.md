I haven't been able to test my code with the ev3 robots so I can't say for sure but I think my code would work in all aspects as I made sure to incorporate code for functional requirements like: the robot detecting blocks with the ultrasonic sensor, if the block was red/yellow the robot picks up the block using grippers and moves it to the allocated drop off zone, and if any other coloured block is in front, it will turn away and keep looking. I also wrote code for non-functional requirements like: the grippers to pick up blocks instead of pushing them. However there could be improvements to enhance the solution by instead of just turning 90 degrees when facing a block that isn't red or yellow, it could use another obstacle avoidance technique as in some scenarios depending where blocks are placed, it could get stuck in an infinite loop. Also another improvement to the code could be the effectiveness of how it searches, as right now it just drives forward til it reaches a block.
