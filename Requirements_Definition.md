# The functional and non-functional requirements of the task:
## Functional:
- Robot travels and if the robot finds red/yellow it takes the block to the drop off zone.
- If any other coloured block is in front, it will turn away and keep looking.
## Non-Functional:
- Grippers because it could push the blocks.
- Effectiveness because of how it searches the perimeter and moves blocks.
- Consistency as it could get stuck sometimes if the code isnâ€™t good.
