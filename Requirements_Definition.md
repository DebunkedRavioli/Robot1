# The functional and non-functional requirements of the task:
## Functional:
- Robot travels detects blocks using ultrasonci sensor.
- Robot uses colour sensor to detect colour.
- If red/yellow the robot picks up the block using grippers and moves it to the allocated drop off zone.
- If any other coloured block is in front, it will turn away and keep looking.
## Non-Functional:
- Grippers because it could push the blocks.
- Effectiveness because of how it searches the perimeter and moves blocks.
- Consistency as it could get stuck sometimes if the code isnâ€™t good.
