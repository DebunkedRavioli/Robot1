# Testing and Debugging
- Because my robot couldn't be tested due to hardware issues, I will include: test case outlines, expected outputs, and a reflection on what could've went wrong and how I would fix it.
# Test case outlines
My code (code.py) is used for an ev3 robot to: Drive and transport a red and a yellow block to a drop-off location. To set it up you must download the code into an ev3 robot and then run the code. After running the code, the ev3 robot should then start driving, it will detect any blocks in the way and if the block is red or yellow, it will pick it up and drop it off at a specified location, if it is any other colour block, the ev3 robot will turn 90 degrees and keep driving til it reaches another block. My code also makes the robot display the distance it is from an object and the colour of object it is facing towards on the ev3 screen. Once the ev3 robot detects a red/yellow block it will play a custom beep sequence to show it has found the desired block.
